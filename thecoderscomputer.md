## Text Editors
Text editors are useful tools that allow web developers to write code. Like programs such as Microsoft Word, text editors allow you to write and edit text. However, certain text editors have features geared towards writing code. They can highlight or color syntax in your code which can make it easier to read and troubleshoot. They can also help type your code more efficiently by suggesting code based on what was typed initially. Extensions for the text editor can also be installed to add even more features. On the learning Markdown page (Links to an external site.), you can see an example of code that is highlighted. Notice how it becomes easier to read than plain text.

## Terminals
The terminal allows users to execute tasks on a computer. Many people are familiar with navigating and using Windows or MacOS to create and manipulate files. Terminals allow you to do the same actions, but instead with typed commands. A command is typed into the terminal and executed; an output is then given back to the user. The benefit to using a terminal is it allows users more control and can make certain tasks easier and faster to perform.

Below are a few examples of commands for terminal.

    username$ code .

This command is used to open the text editor VS Code.

    username$ brew update
This command tells the terminal to update the software Homebrew.

This only scratches the surface of what terminals can do. There are many more commands that can be given to execute tasks.
