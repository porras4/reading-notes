# HTML

## What is HTML?
HTML is a code language that can define the contents of a website to an internet browser. This code can be thought of as the "skeleton" of the website, because it gives it structure. It is the only thing required to make a barebones website. Various **tags** are used to indentify what kind of content is being displayed.

## Commonly used tags to form elements.

Most content is enclosed with an opening and closing tag. Below is an example of a h1 element. The actual content being display is between to two h1 tags.

    <h1>content</h>

The **h1 - h6** tags are used to display headers like the name of section or chapter. The tags h1 through h6 are used show the hierarchy of the headers, h1 being the highest.

    <h1></h1>  
    <h2></h2>
    <h3></h3>
 and so on...

The **p** tag is used to display a paragraph.

    <p></p>


There is even a tag that allows you to add images to your websites. This is an example of a **self closing** tag. Notice how it does not use a closing tag.

    <img scr="source of image" alt="description">

## What is a Wireframe?

Developers needs to make a plan about the website they are going to build before beginning to write its code. A **wireframe** is a plan that shows the website layout. It can be drawn out with many different programs or simply with pen and paper. The layout can be labeled to describe what it will contain and how it will be displayed.
