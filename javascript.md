# JavaScript
## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a code language that developers use to make a website dynamic. It allows the user to interact with the website. To continue using the anatomy analogy, JavaScript could be thought of as the nervous system and muscles of the website.
## Functions
JavaScript uses **functions** to interact with HTML and CSS. A commonly used function is **let**.

    let model = 'Mustang'

In this example, the let function is used to declare the **variable** named "model" as the string "Mustang". A string is a data type that consists of characters. There are other data types, to incluce true and false statements (boolean), and numbers.
## Methods
We can expand on the let function by asking the user for input to declare the variable by using the **method** prompt( ). This will bring an actual prompt up to the user when they access the website. The content inside of the parantheses will be displayed on the prompt. 

    let name = prompt('What is your card model?')

The information gathered from the user's input can then be used to display an output on the website. This is a simple example of how JavaScript can make a website interactive.
