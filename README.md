# Growth Mindset
Hi, my name is Ricardo. My Github can be reached [here](https://github.com/porras4/).
I believe the growth mindset can be thought of as an attitude that promotes **continuous improvement** in oneself.
I try to maintain this attitude with these reminders.
- Each new challenges can be an opportunity for growth.
- Making excuses will not help me accomplish my goals.
- Perseverance is often required to overcome seemingly impossible obstacles.
